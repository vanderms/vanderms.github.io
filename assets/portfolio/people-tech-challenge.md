**Desafio Front End Pessoas de Tech** is a project of a Landing Page created by Mateus Avila from Pessoas de Tech. The details and requisites of the project can be consulted on <https://github.com/mateusavila/dev-pessoas-de-tech-2/>.

My planning was to finish the project in about fifteen hours or three days. So, since the beginning, I knew that to implement the backend side would not be possible considering the time constraints. 

Regarding the frontend part, I was pretty optimistic, despite of not being so sure how to implement some parts of the project.

The navbar as always took me a considerable amount of time to create. But I liked the 'scrolling effect' that happens when the window is scrolled more than 50 pixels. I've seen this effect a lot of times in different websites, but it was the first time, I implemented one myself. 

I think my main discovery in the project was the CSS property `clip-path`. I really liked this property not only because it gives me as a developer more control over the layout, but it also allows me to be more creative as a designer.

As usually, I gave special attention to organize the scss files and to use **DRY** techniques as soon as possible. It made my life very easy and, in the end, lots of parts were been reused. It took me about eight hours to finish the navbar and the hero section and no more than five or six hours to finish the rest of the Landing Page.

Finally, in the future, maybe I will implement the backend part. I've made some research in **Contentful** and **Calendly** and I am very hopeful to use these platforms, maybe in this project.
