This is a website for a photo gallery. 

The main reason I made this project is that I wanted to test if NextJs environment was better than my current Gulp/HTML/SCSS boilerplate at building landing pages and small websites, because of that I didn't bother to make a decent design. Actually, I didn't make a design at all, I just put some dummy content and checked how to style NextJs pages and components.

My intention from the start was to deploy the app in github pages. Not that I dislike Vercel, but considering that my main goal is to build landing pages in commercial projects, I cannot expect that all my clients want to host their websites in Vercel, so I needed to know how hard is to host a NextJs app outside vercel.com.

Deploying in Github was not a hard task, except for the fact that I didn't know that in Github pages you need to create a `.nojekill` file when there is a directory whose name starts with underscore. 

As for the rest, considering that my favorite framework is Reactjs, I really enjoyed learning how to use NextJs.
