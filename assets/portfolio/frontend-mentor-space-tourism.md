Space Tourism is a project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3). 

This is my second project using Nextjs and the first that I hosted in Vercel. For now, I think this technology is quite impressing and I am longing to make more projects with it. The project was not hard, but since it has a lot of pages, 12 to be exact, it was quite laborious.

What I most liked in this experience is that my scss files is getting more organized. I learned about partials and I used Dart Sass with its `@use` and `@forward` rules. I am also working on making the circunstances under which I use **Flexbox** and those under which I use **Grid Layout** more intuitive.

I learned as well about the properties `column-gap` and `row-gap` of **Flexbox**, which I didn't use beacause they are too much new and not all browsers offer support to them. About that, I am considering to write an article about the creation of gaps in **Flexbox**.

Finally, I planned to make the project in two days, what proved to be a bit optmistic. It took me four days or about 20 hours to finish the project.
