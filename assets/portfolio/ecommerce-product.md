Ecommerce Product is one of the challenges proposed on the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) website. And although I only had access to the design in **.png** format, my solution was extremely close to the original design.

I used this project to test two changes from my previous projects. The first one was the use of Typescript in place of JavaScript. And the second is that there was an almost complete replacement of **Flexbox Layout** by **Grid Layout**.

As for TypeScript, DOM manipulation was sometimes a little tricky with countless _type assertions_, given the different types of HTML elements and nodes. On the other hand, `null check` made me recognize an error more than once prematurely, and VSCODE's `autocomplete` works in fact better in TypeScript.

As for the Grid Layout, although sometimes a little more complicated than flexbox since the customization options are greater, the use of `gap` to create a spacing between elements was something that positively surprised me.

Otherwise, the project was relatively simple to build: it took approximately ten hours to complete.
