The project consists of a set of data structures created for the C language. It includes: a dynamic array, a double-linked list, a quadtree, two hashtables with string type keys and int64_t, a string type and wrappers for the primitive types.

There are also methods for error handling and a hashtable structure to check for memory leaks.
